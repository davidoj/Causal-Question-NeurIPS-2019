# How to ask Causal Questions

Repository for "How to Ask a Causal Question" submission for NeurIPS 2019

## TODO 11 Sep 2019:


### Notation
 * Choose Font for power sets

### Causal decision problems

 * Generalised utilities to appendix; redo reduction theorems for regular utilities
 * Type ExD -|> E standard/ExD -|> F to appendix (? think about this one)
 * Explain causal theory vs statistical experiment
 * Mention "underlying state" (set \Theta)
 * Use generalised risk function rather than regret (+ propagate)
 * Move explicit dependence on decision to appendix


### Potential outcomes

 * PO formulates causal query in terms of property of a statistical experiment
 * Formally, cannot answer CSDP without some "glue" assumption

### Appendix

 * Proofs are not using current notation

### Holdover - probably won't do

#### Connection to Causal Bayesian networks

 * Low priority: Connect generalised-SCDP to PO via NPSEM/FFRISTIG
 * Low priority: example of concerns regarding reverse direction (need to define generalised CBN; not clearly worth it)


#### Discussion and conclusion

 * Connect discussion of extension of CBN to existing discussion of faithfulness
 * Open questions:
    * Graphical representation
    * Axiomatisation
    * Do generalised-SCDP contain PO?
    * Counterfactual vs factual utility
    * Connection to causal decision theory (phil)
    * ``Learnability'' (continuity, no free lunch)
    * IFMOCs as causal theories
    * Strictness of causal theories as superset of generalised CBNs
    * Graph learning
 *
