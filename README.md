# How to ask Causal Questions

Repository for "How to Ask a Causal Question" submission for NeurIPS 2019

## TODO 10 May 2019:

 * Prune length

### Abstract

 * Write

### Introduction

 * Restructure: p1 - decision theoretic approach to causality; p2 - causal theories as general object for relationship between data + consequences
 * Mention causal decision theory (Lewis and Woodward)

### Causal decision problems

 * Move discussion of generalised utility to appendix
 * Mention connection to Dawid's work on ECI and decision theoretic causal inference
 * Write up proof of cardinality of Markov kernels and joint distribution; canonical mapping as an open problem
 * Explain: I'm working with IID data so I project the dimension of the sample space down

 
### Connection to Causal Bayesian networks

 * Write up example of risk-identifiability that is not CBN or consistent PO
 * Picking decisions from a PO-style-treatment effect
 * Connect generalised-SCDP to PO via NPSEM/FFRISTIG

 * Low priority: example of concerns regarding reverse direction (need to define generalised CBN; not clearly worth it)


### Discussion and conclusion

 * Connect discussion of extension of CBN to existing discussion of faithfulness
 * Open questions:
    * Graphical representation
    * Axiomatisation
    * Do generalised-SCDP contain PO?
    * Counterfactual vs factual utility
    * Connection to causal decision theory (phil)
    * ``Learnability'' (continuity, no free lunch)
    * IFMOCs as causal theories
    * Strictness of causal theories as superset of generalised CBNs
    * Graph learning
 *
