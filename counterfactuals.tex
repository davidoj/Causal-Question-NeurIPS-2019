\section{Potential Outcomes}

Potential Outcomes is a major rival to the approach typified by Causal Bayesian Networks for formulating causal questions and hypotheses. Causal queries in the Potential Outcomes framework concern the distribution of random variables $\RV{Y}_0, \RV{Y}_1$ representing potential outcomes, or ``the value $\RV{Y}$ would take if action 0 or 1 were taken respectively'' (\cite{angrist_mastering_2014}). 

Queries based on the Potential Outcomes framework concern properties of the joint distribution over observations and potential outcome variables - that is, they resemble ordinary statistical decision problems. If, as we have supposed, our starting point is preferences over outcomes then the identification of a causal effect in this framework does not automatically allow for us to determine preferences over decisions, as the Potential Outcomes framework does not formally specify a canonical consequence map given a particular joint distribution over potential outcome variables. 

We do have an informal notion of how this should be constructed - namely that the potential outcome $\RV{Y}_1$ is the value $\RV{Y}$ would take if action 1 were taken. We can formalise this with the notion of consequence consistency. Let $\Delta(\mathcal{Y}_\circ)$ be the space of joint distributions over real and potential outcomes of $\RV{Y}$. A consequence map $\kappa:D\to \Delta(\mathcal{Y}_\circ)$ is consequence consistent if
\begin{align}
    \kappa(i;(\RV{Y}_i-\RV{Y})^{-1}(A))=\delta_0(A) \label{eq:oc_consist}
\end{align} 
Consequence consistency is similar to the consistency condition (e.g., see \cite{richardson2013single}).

A causal theory $\mathscr{T}^{cc}$ that is consequence consistent need not require any particular relationship between an ``observed'' distribution $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{Y}_\circ)$ and an associated consequence $\kappa$. A straightforward option for making this connection is to assert equality of distributions; a causal theory $\mathscr{T}^{cc,eq}$ is consequence consistent and counterfactually equal if for all $(\mu,\kappa)\in\mathscr{T}^{cc,eq}$
\begin{align}
    \kappa(i;\RV{X}_i^{-1}(A))=\mu(\RV{X}_i^{-1}(A))
\end{align}
There are many choices that could be made here, as can be seen in Example \ref{ex:nonst_distn}.

\begin{example}[Performance bias]\label{ex:nonst_distn}
Suppose we have a randomised experiment $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ with random variables $\RV{X}$, $\RV{X}_0$ and $\RV{X}_1$ and have determined $\mathbb{E}_\mu[\RV{X}_0]$ and $\mathbb{E}_\mu[\RV{X}_1]$ via ignorability. Consequence consistency is assumed, but performance bias is suspected - that is, we believe the value of $\delta_i \kappa \RV{X}_i$ may differ from $\RV{X}_i$ (performance bias is defined by \cite{collaboration_cochrane_nodate}). There are many ways to handle this suspicion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assume performance bias is absent $\delta_i \kappa \RV{X}_i = \mathbb{E}_\mu[\RV{X}_i]$
    \item Assume performance bias has a uniform additive effect: $\delta_i \kappa \RV{X}_i = \mathbb{E}_\mu[\RV{X}_i]+k$; in this case the average treatment effect is still known $\delta_1 \kappa \RV{X}_1 - \delta_0\kappa\RV{X}_0 = \mathbb{E}[\RV{X}_1]-\mathbb{E}[\RV{X}_0]$
    \item Assume performance bias has a bounded additive effect: $\delta_i \kappa \RV{X}_i = \mathbb{E}_\mu[\RV{X}_i]+k_i$, $|k_i|<l$; then bounds can be placed on the average treatment effect.
    \item Apply a prior probability to possible values of performance bias.
    \item Avoid assumptions about the effect of performance bias; then there is no particular relationship between $\mu F_{\RV{X}_i}$ and $\delta_i \kappa F_{\RV{X}_i}$.
\end{itemize}

\end{example}

A causal theory for Potential Outcomes is associated with a much larger hypothesis class than any causal theory that works only with distributions over observable variables. Theorem \ref{th:scdp_obu_red} shows that given any SCDP based on Potential Outcomes, provided that the potential outcome variables are unobserved and the utility does not depend on them, a reduced SCDP can be constructed by marginalising over potential outcomes. While these conditions may seem reasonable, there are some examples of problems where one does apparently care about the values of potential outcome variables. The \emph{effect of treatment on the treated} (ETT) that depends on counterfactual quantities and has some relevance to decision preferences \cite{rubin_estimating_1974}, though it is controversial whether this dependence is necessary \cite{geneletti2007defining}. More straightforwardly, the legal standard of ``no harm but for the defendant's negligence'' does seem to invoke fundamentally counterfactual considerations \cite{pearl_causality:_2009}.
