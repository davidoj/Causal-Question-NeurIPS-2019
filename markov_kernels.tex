\section{Definitions}

\cheng{One sentence describing the difference between $E$ and $\mathcal{E}$. Explicitly say that you are using caligraphic letters to mean measures, e.g. $\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{H}$ below.}

\cheng{Generally, you need to define notation (instead of expecting the reader to infer from type signatures).}

\cheng{You need to clarify the distinction between measures and probability measures.}

Given two measureable sets $(E,\mathcal{E})$ and $(F,\mathcal{F})$, a \emph{Markov kernel} $K:E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$ is a map where
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The map $x\mapsto K(x;B)$ is $\mathcal{E}$-measurable for every $B\in\mathcal{F}$
    \item The map $B\mapsto K(x;B)$ is a probability measure on $(F,\mathcal{F})$ for every $x\in E$
\end{enumerate}

Abusing notation somewhat, we will write the set of Markov kernels of type $E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$ as $\Delta(\mathcal{F})^D$.

Two Markov kernels $K:E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$ and $K':E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$ are $\mu$-almost surely equivalent given $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{E})$ if
\begin{align}
    \int_A K(x;B) d\mu = \int_A K'(x;B) d\mu\qquad\forall A\in \mathcal{E}, B\in\mathcal{F}
\end{align}

Given $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{E})$ and a sub-$\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathcal{E}$, there is a Markov kernel $\mu_{\mathcal{D}}:E\to\Delta(\mathcal{E})$ such that for $A\in\mathcal{E}$ and $B\in \mathcal{D}$, $\int_B \mu_{\RV{X}}(y;A) d\mu(y) = \mu(A\cap B)$. $\mu_{\mathcal{D}}$ is a \emph{conditional probability distribution} with respect to $\mathcal{D}$. Given a set of random variables $\mathbf{X}=\{\RV{X}^i\}_{i\in [N]}$ with domain $(E,\mathcal{E})$, $\mu_{\mathbf{X}}$ is a conditional probability distribution with respect to the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathbf{X}$: $\sigma(\cup_{i\in[N]}\sigma(\mathcal{X}^i))$.

\subsection{Operations with Markov kernels}

For the following, assume $K$ is a Markov kernel from $E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$, L is a Markov kernel $F\to \Delta(\mathcal{G})$, $\mu$ is a probability measure on $(E,\mathcal{E})$ and $f$ is a nonnegative measurable function $F\to \mathbb{F}$. More details can be found in Appendix \ref{app:markov_kernels}

\cheng{$\mathbb{F}$ needs clarification.}

The notation here borrows heavily from \cite{cinlar_probability_2011} and \cite{fong_causal_2013}.

\cheng{You need to write a small tutorial about Markov kernels, otherwise reader cannot follow.}

\subsubsection{Kernel products}

\cheng{Explicitly say that $KL$ is a product of kernels $K$ and $L$. Symmetric? Distributive? Similarly for all the other products.}

$KL$ is a Markov kernel $E\to \Delta(\mathcal{G})$ such that
\begin{align}
    KL(x;B):= \int_F K(x;dy) L(y;B),\qquad x\in E, B\in \mathcal{G}
\end{align}

$\mu K$ is a probability measure on $(F,\mathcal{F})$ such that
\begin{align}
    \mu K(B)=\int_E \mu(dx) K(x;B),\qquad B\in\mathcal{F}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Special kernels and operations}


$I_E$ is the identify kernel $E\to \Delta(\mathcal{E})$ defined by $x\mapsto \delta_x$. It has the properties $\mu I_E=\mu$, $KI_F = K$, $I_E K = K$, $I_F f=f$.
=======
\cheng{Motivate why we need these special definitions. I think the kernels are special, but operations not.}

\cheng{Also teach the reader how to say the symbols $\splitter{0.15}, \stopper{0.15}$.}



Given some measurable function $g:E\to F$, the kernel $F_g:E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$ is defined by $x\mapsto \delta_{g(x)}$. It is easy to check that $F_g F_g = F_g$. For $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{E})$, the product $\mu F_g$ is the push forward measure $g_*\mu$. 

Given $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{E}$, $\mu\splitter{0.15}(I_E\otimes K)$ is a distribution in $\Delta(\mathcal{E}\otimes\mathcal{F})$ given by
\begin{align}
    \mu\splitter{0.15}(I_E\otimes K)(A\times B) = \int_A K(x;B) d\mu(x)\qquad \forall A\in \mathcal{E},B\in \mathcal{F}
\end{align}


Given a set of random variables $\{\RV{X}^i\}_{i\in[N]}$ with domain $(E,\mathcal{E})$,  $\mu\splitter{0.15}(\otimes_{i\in[N]} F_{\RV{X}^i})$ is the joint distribution the set.

\cheng{Reviewers are not going to be patient enough to sit through 2 pages of definitions. You need to motivate why you need so many spaces, measures, products, etc.}
