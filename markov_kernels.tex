\section{Definitions and key notation}\label{sec:dfin}

We use three notations for working with probability theory. The ``elementary'' notation makes use of regular symbolic conventions (functions, products, sums, integrals, unions etc.) along with the expectation operator $\mathbb{E}$. This is the most flexible notation which comes at the cost of being verbose and difficult to read. Secondly, we use a semi-formal string diagram notation extending the formal diagram notation for symmetric monoidal categories \cite{selinger_survey_2010}. Objects in this diagram refer to stochastic maps, and by interpreting diagrams as symbols we can, in theory, be just as flexible as the purely symbolic approach. However, we avoid complex mixtures of symbols and diagrams elements, and fall back to symbolic representations if it is called for. Finally, we use a matrix-vector product convention that isn't particularly expressive but can compactly express some common operations.

\subsection{Probability Theory}

Given a set $A$, a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is a collection of subsets of $A$ where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $A\in \mathcal{A}$ and $\emptyset\in \mathcal{A}$
	\item $B\in \mathcal{A}\implies B^C\in\mathcal{A}$
	\item $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under countable unions: For any countable collection $\{B_i|i\in Z\subset \mathbb{N}\}$ of elements of $\mathcal{A}$, $\cup_{i\in Z}B_i\in \mathcal{A}$ 
\end{itemize}

A measurable space $(A,\mathcal{A})$ is a set $A$ along with a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Sometimes the sigma algebra will be left implicit, in which case $A$ will just be introduced as a measurable space.

\paragraph{Common $\sigma$ algebras}

For any $A$, $\{\emptyset,A\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. In particular, it is the only sigma algebra for any one element set $\{*\}$.

For countable $A$, the power set $\mathscr{P}(A)$ is known as the discrete $\sigma$-algebra.

Given $A$ and a collection of subsets of $B\subset\mathscr{P}(A)$, $\sigma(B)$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all the elements of $B$. 

Let $T$ be all the open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. Then $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}):=\sigma(T)$ is the \emph{Borel $\sigma$-algebra} on the reals. This definition extends to an arbitrary topological space $A$ with topology $T$.

A \emph{standard measurable set} is a measurable set $A$ that is isomorphic either to a discrete measurable space $A$ or $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$. For any $A$ that is a complete separable metric space, $(A,\mathcal{B}(A))$ is standard measurable. 

Given a measurable space $(E,\mathcal{E})$, a map $\mu:\mathcal{E}\to [0,1]$ is a \emph{probability measure} if
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mu(E)=1$, $\mu(\emptyset)=0$
	\item Given countable collection $\{A_i\}\subset\mathscr{E}$, $\mu(\cup_{i} A_i) = \sum_i \mu(A_i)$
\end{itemize}

Write by $\Delta(\mathcal{E})$ the set of all probability measures on $\mathcal{E}$.

Given a second measurable space $(F,\mathcal{F})$, a \emph{stochastic map} or \emph{Markov kernel} is a map $\mathbf{M}:E\times\mathcal{F}\to [0,1]$ such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item The map $\mathbf{M}(\cdot;A):x\mapsto \mathbf{M}(x;A)$ is $\mathcal{E}$-measurable for all $A\in \mathcal{F}$
	\item The map $\mathbf{M}_x:A\mapsto \mathbf{M}(x;A)$ is a probability measure on $F$ for all $x\in E$
\end{itemize}

Extending the subscript notation above, for $\mathbf{C}:X\times Y\to \Delta(\mathcal{Z})$  and $x\in X$ we will write $\mathbf{C}_x$ for the ``curried'' map $y\mapsto \mathbf{C}_{x,y}$.

The map $x\mapsto \mathbf{M}_x$ is of type $E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$. We will abuse notation somewhat to write $\mathbf{M}:E\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$, which captures the intuition that a Markov kernel maps from elements of $E$ to probability measures on $\mathcal{F}$. Note that we ``reverse'' this idea and consider Markov kernels to map from elements of $\mathcal{F}$ to measurable functions $E\to[0,1]$, an interpretation found in \citet{clerc_pointless_2017}, but (at this stage) we don't make use of this interpretation here.

Given an indiscrete measurable space $(\{*\},\{\{*\},\emptyset\})$, we identify Markov kernels $\mathbf{N}:\{*\}\to \Delta(\mathcal{E})$ with the probability measure $\mathbf{N}_*$. In addition, there is a unique Markov kernel $\stopper{0.2}:E\to \Delta(\{\{*\},\emptyset\})$ given by $x\mapsto \delta_*$ for all $x\in E$ which we will call the ``discard'' map

\paragraph{Nonstandard view of Random Variables}

We take a slightly nonstandard view of random variables. Random variables are typically defined to be measurable functions on a probability space $\langle \Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu\rangle$ \citep{cinlar_probability_2011}. With this definition, a random variable $\RV{X}:\Omega\to E$ has a canonical probability measure given by the pushforward of $\mu$: for all $A\in\mathscr{E}$ $\RV{X}_\# \mu(A) = \mu(\RV{X}^{-1}(A))$.

We take a random variable to be a measurable function on a \emph{kernel space} $\langle F,\mathcal{F},\mathbf{M}, G\rangle$ where $\mathbf{M}:G\to \Delta(\mathcal{F})$ is a Markov kernel. A random variable $\RV{X}:F\to E$ has a probability distribution only relative to some argument measure $\nu\in\Delta(\mathcal{G})$. Because of this, we cannot in general unambiguously talk about ``the'' distribution of a given random variable. We avoid $P(\RV{X})$ type notation to ambiguity in this regard. 

The reason for this choice is that random variables in this work model quantities with distributions that depend on the decision maker's choices.

\subsection{Product Notation}

We can use a notation similar to matrix-vector products to represent operations with Markov kernels. Probability measures $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{X})$ can be read as row vectors, Markov kernels as matrices and measurable functions $\RV{T}:Y\to T$ as column vectors. Defining $\mathbf{M}:X\to \Delta(\mathcal{Y})$ and $\mathbf{N}:Y\to \Delta(\mathcal{Z})$, the measure-kernel product $\mu \mathbf{A} (G) := \int \mathbf{A}_x (G) d\mu(x)$ yields a probability measure $\mu\mathbf{A}$ on $\mathcal{Z}$, the kernel-kernel product $\mathbf{M}\mathbf{N}(x;H)=\int_Y \mathbf{B}(y;H)d\mathbf{A}_x$ yields a kernel $\mathbf{M}\mathbf{N}:X\to \Delta(\mathcal{Z})$ and the kernel-function product $\mathbf{A}\RV{T}(x):=\int_Y \RV{T}(y) d\mathbf{A}_x$ yields a measurable function $X\to T$. Kernel products are associative \citep{cinlar_probability_2011}.

The tensor product $(\mathbf{M}\otimes \mathbf{N})(x,y;G,H) := \mathbf{M}(x;G)\mathbf{N}(y;H)$ yields a kernel $(\mathbf{M}\otimes \mathbf{N}):X\times Y\to \Delta(\mathcal{Y}\otimes\mathcal{Z})$.

\subsection{String Diagrams}

Some constructions are unwieldly in product notation; for example, given $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{E})$ and $\mathbf{M}:E\to (\mathcal{F})$, it is not straightforward to construct a measure $\nu\in\Delta(\mathcal{E}\otimes\mathcal{F})$ that captures the ``joint distribution'' given by $A\times B\mapsto \int_A \mathbf{M}(x;B)d\mu$. 

Such constructions can, however, be straightforwardly captured with string diagrams, a notation developed for category theoretic probability. \citet{cho_disintegration_2019} also provides an extensive introduction to the notation discussed here.

Some key ideas of string diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic string diagrams can always be interpreted as a mixture of kernel-kernel products and tensor products of Markov kernels
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Extended string diagrams can be interepreted as a mixture of kernel-kernel products, kernel-function products, tensor products of kernels and functions and scalar products 
	\end{itemize}
	\item String diagrams are the subject of a coherence theorem: taking a string diagram and applying a planar deformation yields a string diagram that represents the same kernel \citep{selinger_survey_2010}. This also holds for a number of additional transformations detailed below
\end{itemize}

A kernel $\mathbf{A}:X\to \Delta(\mathcal{Y})$ is written as a box with input and output wires, probability measures $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{X})$ are written as triangles ``closed on the left'' and measurable functions (which are only elements of the ``extended'' notation) $\RV{T}:Y\to T$ as triangles ``closed on the right''.

\begin{align}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\path (0,0) coordinate (A)
++(0.5,0) node[kernel] (B) {$\mathbf{A}$}
++(0.5,0) coordinate (C);
\draw (A) -- (B) -- (C);
\end{tikzpicture}\qquad
\begin{tikzpicture}
\path (0,0) node[dist] (B) {$\mu$}
++(0.5,0) coordinate (C);
\draw (B) -- (C);
\end{tikzpicture}\qquad
\begin{tikzpicture}
\path (0,0) coordinate (A)
++(0.5,0) node[expectation] (B) {$\RV{T}$};
\draw (A) -- (B);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{align}




We canonically regard a probability measure $\mu\in \Delta(\mathcal{E})$ to be a Markov kernel $\mu:\{*\}\to \Delta(\mathcal{E})$. This allows for the definition of ``basic'' string diagrams for which Markov kernels are the only building blocks. Such a definition isn't possible for measurable functions. Suppose we try supposing a measurable function $f:E\to \mathbb{R}$ is ``really'' a Markov kernel $f:E\to \Delta(\{*\})$. The problem is, depending on the input $x\in E$, $f(x)$ is not in general equal to $1$, and so this supposition fails. This is the reason we require an ``extended'' string diagram notation if we wish to incorporate functions and expectations.

The identity $\mathbf{Id}:X\to \Delta(X)$ is the Markov kernel $x\mapsto \delta_x$, which we represent with a bare wire \begin{tikzpicture}\draw (0,0) -- (1,0); \end{tikzpicture}. 

The copy map $\splitter{0.1}:X\to \Delta(X\times X)$ is the Markov kernel $x\mapsto \delta_{(x,x)}$. For $\mathbf{A}:X\to \Delta(Y)$ and $\mathbf{B}:X\to \Delta(Z)$, $\splitter{0.1} (A\otimes B)_x  = A_x \otimes B_x$ - the copy map forces two tensored Markov kernels to share the same values of inputs. 

The discard map $\stopper{0.2}$ is the Markov kernel $X\to \{\#\}$ given by $x\mapsto \delta_\#$, where $\#$ is some one element set. Placing boxes side by side with connected wires corresponds to taking kernel products as defined above.

We will apply these notions to a couple of example constructions. Given $\mu\in\Delta(X),\mathbf{A}:X\to \Delta(Y)$ as before, the joint distribution on $X\times Y$ given by $\nu(A\times B) = \int_A A(x;B)d\mu(x)$ is given in string diagram on the left of \ref{eq:jdist}. Marginalisation is accomplished with the discard map $\stopper{0.2}$; hence $\mu\splitter{0.1}(\mathbf{Id}\otimes \mathbf{A}\stopper{0.2}) = \mu$; this is shown on the right of \ref{eq:jdist}

\begin{align}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\path (0,0) node[dist] (mu) {$\mu$}
++ (1,0) coordinate (copy0)
+ (1.2,0.5) node (X) {$\RV{X}$}
++ (0.5,-0.5) node[kernel] (A) {$\mathbf{A}$}
++(0.7,0) node (Y) {$\RV{Y}$};
\draw (mu)--(copy0);
\draw (copy0) to [bend left] (X);
\draw (copy0) to [bend right] (A) (A) -- (Y);
\end{tikzpicture}\qquad
\begin{tikzpicture}
\path (0,0) node[dist] (mu) {$\mu$}
++ (1,0) coordinate (copy0)
+ (1.2,0.5) node (X) {$\RV{X}$}
++ (0.5,-0.5) node[kernel] (A) {$\mathbf{A}$}
++(0.7,0) node (Y) {};
\draw (mu)--(copy0);
\draw (copy0) to [bend left] (X);
\draw[-{Rays [n=8]}] (copy0) to [bend right] (A) (A) -- (Y);
\end{tikzpicture}=
\begin{tikzpicture}
\path (0,0) node[dist] (MU) {$\mu$}
+ (0.5,0) node (X) {$\RV{X}$};
\draw (MU) -- (X);
\end{tikzpicture}\label{eq:jdist}
\end{align}
